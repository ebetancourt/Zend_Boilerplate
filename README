##Boiler Plate Zend Project##
Nothing fancy, just a basic Zend project configured the way I like it, with multiple modules (for API, CMS, Administrators, and front end), config files, and the debug tool set up.

Classes already set up in the library for:
* Authentication
* ACL
* Automatic Caching (via wrapper class)
* Database Connection factory
* Logging to firebug via wildfire.
